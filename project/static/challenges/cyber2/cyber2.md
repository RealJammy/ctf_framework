# Cyber2

## Description
 To start generating some wacky ideas, we're moving away from the simple angr rev and the bypass-of-a-canary-implementing-shellcode pwn. Instead, we're moving towards mobile rev and pwn.

The file is located on my CTF platform that I've created. You can find the challenge labelled `Cyber2`, which will have the same description as this. The link to it is at http://3.8.170.149:8080
If it so happens that the website is down at any time, please follow these steps:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/EuanB26/ctf_framework.git
$ export FLASK_APP=ctf_framework.py
$ export ADMIN_NAME="euanb26"
$ export ADMIN_EMAIL="euanb26@gmail.com"
$ export ADMIN_PWD="testing123"
$ cd ctf_framework
$ flask run --port=5000 --host=127.0.0.1
```
And then, for Cyber2, you will need to run some docker files, which has been preloaded in `project/static/writeup/cyber2/docker_commands.sh`.
