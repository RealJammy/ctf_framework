          I like to hang about on discord (and when this starts, there may be a discord server open), so there'll be more information to come!

        <p class="card-text">
          I am a student who is very interested in cyber-security. I have specalised in reverse engineering and binary exploitation, competing for my team <b>The WinRaRs <a href="https://ctftime.org/team/113086" class="text-warning">(CTFtime)</a></b>. We're currently ranking 2nd in the UK, and 70th worldwide! We also have a Gitbook with our <b><a href="https://the-winrars.gitbook.io/writeups/" class="text-warning">writeups</a></b> for past CTF events, and a <b><a href="https://the-winrars.gitbook.io/references/" class="text-warning">references pages</a></b> to learn about the different categories (Go check out the <b><a href="https://the-winrars.gitbook.io/references/reverse-engineering/assembly" class="text-warning">reverse engineering</a></b> section, that's what I did!)
        <p>
        <p class="card-text">
          I also have my own personal Gitbook which has been a massive work in progress, mainly covering binary exploitation, which can be seen <b><a href="https://euanb26.gitbook.io/resources/" class="text-warning">here</a></b>. This has been my pride and joy, and I've taught friends from this, in which they've given back praises.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
          In addition to all this, I've also participated in Cyber Discovery, in which I've been invited to the final section, Elite, for the past two years (2019, 2020). This year, Elite has invited me to take the SANS SEC504 course, and I am now a <b><a href="https://www.giac.org/certified-professional/euan-balmer/192528" class="text-warning">GCIH</a></b>. I also developed and got 2 challenges in (out of 50) for CCC, Cyber Discovery's Content Creators Club.

          This project was started on the 24th of October, 2020.<br>
