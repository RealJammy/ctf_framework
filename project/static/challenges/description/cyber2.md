# Cyber2

## Description
Agent, we've been tasked with something ... rather interesting. We've had mission control take a quick scan of the file, and felt that it's probably wise that we get our #1 agent on it ASAP.

The file is located on my CTF platform that I've created. You can find the challenge labelled `Cyber2`, which will have the same description as this.
Your also welcome to take a look at the CTF framework that I've developed for this. Link is [Here]()
