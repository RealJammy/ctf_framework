# Cyber1

## Description
Our forensics team back in the lab have managed to receive some malware, and upon analysis have found this file. Can you have a look and see if you can pull anything from it? (Just to note, this isn't malware, that's a fictional story behind this file).

The file is located on my CTF platform that I've created. You can find the challenge labelled `Cyber1`, which will have the same description as this. The link to it is at http://3.8.170.149:8080.
If it so happens that the website is down at any time, please follow these steps:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/EuanB26/ctf_framework.git
$ export FLASK_APP=ctf_framework.py
$ export ADMIN_NAME="euanb26"
$ export ADMIN_EMAIL="euanb26@gmail.com"
$ export ADMIN_PWD="testing123"
$ cd ctf_framework
$ flask run --port=5000 --host=127.0.0.1
```
