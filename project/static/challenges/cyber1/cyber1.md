# Cyber1

## Description
Our forensics team back in the lab have managed to receive some malware, and upon analysis have found this file. Can you have a look and see if you can pull anything from it? (Just to note, this isn't malware, that's a fictional story behind this file).

The file is located on my CTF platform that I've created. You can find the challenge labelled `Cyber1`, which will have the same description as this.
Your also welcome to take a look at the CTF framework that I've developed for this. Link is [Here]()
