        This is a CTF created by myself, Euan. It is a jeopardy-style CTF, with a variety of challenges, including:
      </p>
        <dl class="card-text">
          <li>binary exploitation</li>
          <li>reverse engineering</li>
          <li>crypto</li>
          <li>web</li>
          <li>forensics</li>
          <li>misc</li>
        </dl>
      <p class="text-white text-left">
        The competition will be running for a certain period of time. The aim of a CTF is to gain flags and score points. The more points you score, the higher you climb up the <a href="{{ url_for('scoreboard') }}" class="text-warning">leaderboard</a>.<br>
        To score points, you have to submit flags. Flags are just a string of characters, such as <code style="background-color:#85e3b1; color:#17206d">flag{sanity_check_fl4g}</code><br>
        Flags are in the format <code style="background-color:#85e3b1; color:#17206d">flag{.*}</code>

        We can't let you just running around wild now, can we. Let's set out some rules so that this platform can (hopefully) run smoothly.
        <ol class="text-left">
          <li>
            Please don't bruteforce any flags. That takes the fun out of the CTF. It also means that you don't learn any new techniques
          </li>
          <li>
            Please don't share any flags. Flag sharing is prohibited, and will result in a ban from the platform.
          </li>
          <li>Don't attack the infrastrcuture</li>
        </ol>
